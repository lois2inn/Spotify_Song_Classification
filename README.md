# Spotify_Song_Classification

## Overview

One of the aspects of Spotify’s song recommendations is using user data on songs that have been liked in the past. We need to analyze the liked songs in order to
know what similar song a user might also enjoy. We will create a basic binary classification model to predict a like or no like on songs. Our chosen solution scope does not create recommendations, but simply labels for provided songs with a 0 for not like or a 1 for like.
