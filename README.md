# Spotify_Song_Classification

## Overview

A dataset from Spotify API is downloaded. Each song is labelled 0 or 1. 1 to say that the song is liked. 0 for song is not liked. 
One of the aspects of Spotifyâ€™s song recommendations is using user data on songs that have been liked in the past. We need to analyze the liked songs in order to
know what similar song a user might also enjoy. 
Create a basic binary classification model to predict a like or no like on songs. Our chosen solution scope does not create recommendations, but simply labels
for provided songs with a 0 for not like or a 1 for like.
